**Sequence Modeling**

Sequence modeling involves understanding and analyzing sequences of data, where the order of the elements is important. This can include various types of data, such as text, speech, DNA sequences, and more. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are common architectures used for sequence modeling.

**Applications of Sequence Modeling**

1.Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Understanding and generating human language, including tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

2.Speech Recognition

Converting spoken language into text, used in applications like voice assistants.

3.Time Series Prediction

Predicting future values based on historical data, which brings us to time series analysis.
