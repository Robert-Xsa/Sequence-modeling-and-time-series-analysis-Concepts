**Sequence Modeling**

Sequence modeling involves understanding and analyzing sequences of data, where the order of the elements is important. This can include various types of data, such as text, speech, DNA sequences, and more. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are common architectures used for sequence modeling.
